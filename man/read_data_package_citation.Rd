Read data package citation

\details{
A citation may consist of a list of authors, publication year, 
title, data package version, publisher, digital object identifier, and 
access date. The order and presence of these components depends on the 
\code{style} requested for the citation (see query parameters above).

A brief discussion of the fields in a citation:
\itemize{
  \item Authors - This function uses content extracted from the science 
  metadata described by an Ecological Metadata Language (EML) document to 
  generate the author list. Specifically, it uses the creator section of EML 
  to generate the list of authors, including individuals, organizations, and 
  positions.
  
  This function preserves the order of the creator list as defined within 
  the EML document. As such, if you would like the citation to begin with an 
  organization name, you should position the creator element that describes 
  the organization at the beginning of the creator list in the EML document.
  
  This function also assumes that a creator element contains information 
  pertaining to only a single "creator", although EML allows for multiple 
  identities in a single creator element. It will do its best to 
  accommodate multi-named subjects within a creator element, but mileage 
  will vary.
  
  This function is opinionated in how it determines an author: individuals, 
  take precedence over organizations and positions, and organizations take 
  precedence over positions. What this means is if an individual and 
  organization and position are all defined in a single creator element, 
  this function sets the author to the named information within the 
  individual element; and, if only an organization and position exist within 
  a single creator element, this function will set the author to the named 
  information within the organization element. Finally, if only a position 
  is defined within a single creator element, this function will set the 
  author to the named information within the position element. It is 
  important to note that this function respects the creator content as 
  defined in the EML document and will set a position name to an author if 
  it is present and meets the above hierarchy. If you believe that a 
  position should not be displayed as data package author, then you should 
  not include it as a data package creator.
  
  Finally, this function does not collect or use tertiary information (e.g., 
  phone number, addresses, emails) from within the creator element since 
  this type of information is not used as part of a data package citation.
  
  \item Publication Year - The publication year is defined by the calendar 
  year when the data package was archived into the EDI data repository. The 
  publication year may differ from the year of the publication date entered 
  into the EML, which is often set to the date when the data package became 
  publicly available, although not yet archived into the EDI data 
  repository.
  
  \item Title - This function uses the title section of EML as the citation 
  title. EML title elements are copied verbatim into the citation.
  
  \item Version Number - The citation version number represents the revision 
  step (or increment) of the data package as archived in the EDI data 
  repository. Revision values are whole numbers and have a one-to-one 
  correspondence to the revision of the data package in the repository.
  
  \item Publisher - By default, the publisher field of the citation is 
  permanently set to "Environmental Data Initiative". This value will not 
  change during the tenure of the EDI data repository.
  
  \item DOI - The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is the EDI generated DOI 
  value that is registered with DataCite, and is displayed using the fully 
  qualified "doi.org" URL. This DOI URL will resolve to the corresponding 
  "landing page" of the data package as displayed on the EDI Data Portal.
  
  \item Access Date - The access date is the UTC date in which the citation 
  was requested.
